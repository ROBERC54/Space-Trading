Requirements

The goal of this project is to build a space-trading game with the following characteristics:
MVP

    Console-/text-based
    Goal: Trade any goods/services between planets for profit
    Compelling Story, including a "good ending" and "bad ending"
    Bad ending: 65 years old or assets with total value <= 0
    Starting conditions: 18 year old character with a ship and goods or means to acquire a ship and goods
    Minimum of 5 planets: Earth, Alpha Centauri 1 (use the actual distance to Alpha Centauri), and three others of your choosing
    Distance/time relation based on Star Trek TNG warp equation (provided below)
    2-D grid system with Earth as the origin
    One universal currency
    Minimum of 5 items of trade

Stretch goals

    "Character builder" with race/gender/etc.
    Space piracy/battles
    Illness
    Fuel usage
    Fuel requirements based on speed/load carried
    Ship load limits/upgrades
    Fluctuating economy
    Intelligence (paid or based on affinity with planets) or Scuttlebutt (overheard or based on affinity with NPCs), particularly regarding cost of items in other locations
    Additional means of acquiring goods

Warp Equation

Given Warp speed (W) with non-inclusive bounds of 0 and 10, velocity in multiples of the speed of light = W(10/3)  + (10 âˆ’ W)(-11/3).

Thus, if you want to travel to a location 1 light year away in one day, you need a warp factor which equates to a velocity of 365.25 times the speed of light.
